introduction:
  header: Hi, I'm Kyle.
  main: |
    I'm a software engineer who likes tinkering with things. I mess with web technologies 
    and occassionally a bit of game dev.

    Currently, I work as a full stack web developer building an ecosystem of APIs and web 
    applications using technologies like .NET Core, NextJS, React, and Typescript.
  future: |
    Going into 2023, I'm trying to focus on branching out into other domains of software than 
    what I'm used to, like systems programming and embeded software. In that vein, I've been 
    perusing and toying with the lower level languages such as C, C++, Rust, etc.
