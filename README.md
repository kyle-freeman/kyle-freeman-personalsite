# Hello :)

This repo contains the code for my personal [site](https://kyle-freeman.deno.dev)

It's built with [Lume](https://lume.land/), a static site generator built for the [Deno](https://deno.land/) JavaScript runtime.
It uses [preact](https://preactjs.com/) for UI components and the [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) preprocesser for styling.
